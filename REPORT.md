### 1. Introduction <br />
> Employers are responsible for managing their employees' schedules efficiently to ensure high-quality production output. However, the ever-changing nature of employment makes it difficult for employers to maintain real-time communication and update all the necessary information at once. Recognizing the need for a more efficient and user-friendly solution, we present our innovative web-based software application. Our software is An advanced scheduling tool designed to empower employers and employees. This application revolutionizes traditional scheduling methods, allowing employees to actively manage their schedules while relieving employers of the burdensome task of manually coordinating every job. Numerous scheduling software products are available in the market, but most impose user restrictions and charge a monthly subscription fee of up to $60.<br />
>
> In contrast, our solution offers a comprehensive platform without the excessive costs associated with restricted user access. It makes it an ideal choice for businesses of all sizes, ensuring accessibility to a broader spectrum of users. In the subsequent sections, we will delve deeper into our scheduling application's key features and benefits, illustrating how it addresses the challenges posed by dynamic schedules and enhances overall workforce management.
### 2. Design Problem
#### 2.1 Problem Definition <br />
>Manually scheduling a workforce presents a significant challenge for employers as it requires them to invest considerable time and resources in creating and updating schedules. Employees also need help managing their schedules and often rely on direct communication with managers to select shifts. Existing scheduling applications in the market, such as Connecteam and Homebase, are costly, limiting accessibility for many businesses. Our project aims to develop an open-source, free workforce scheduling software that streamlines communication between employers and employees. It includes availability submission and adding or dropping shifts to enhance productivity.<br />

#### 2.2 Design Requirements <br />
> **2.2.1 Functions** <br />
> 1. Sign-up:<br />
> Users can create an account by providing necessary information, including username, email, and password.
>
> 2. Login:<br />
> Registered users can securely log in to the system using their credentials, gaining access to the scheduling application.
>
> 3. Submit Availability (in Schedule Page):<br />
> Employees can submit their availability for different shifts through an intuitive and user-friendly schedule page.
>
> 4. Manage Shift (Employers Only): <br />
> Employers can add or drop selected employees from specific shifts, facilitating efficient workforce management.
> 
> **2.2.2 Objective** <br />
> 1. Employees can choose and view their shifts for the week. <br />
> 2. Managers can add or drop employees from a shift. <br />
> 3. Managers can view the entire schedule and share it with all employees. <br />
>
> **2.2.3 Constraints** <br />
> 1. Economic Factors:<br />
> The application is completely free to use and helps in saving on manual supplies. <br />
> 2. Regulatory Compliance:<br />
> The application provides authentication, salting and hashing, and authorization. <br />
> 3. Ethics: <br />
> The application adheres to copyright regulations for photos and logos. <br />
> 4. Sustainability and Environmental Factors: <br />
> The application allows users to save paper and supplies.<br />
> 5. Societal Impacts: <br />
> The application allows users to reduce workload and stress. <br />

### 3. Solution
#### Figure 1: Solution 1<br />
> Employees can enter their own timings for shifts, but this does not align with the design requirements of having the manager in control of the shifts<br />
>

> <br />
>
> 
#### Figure 2: Solution 2 <br />
> This solution is an improvement over Solution 1 because it provides employees with a limited set of options chosen by the manager. However, it still allows employees the flexibility to choose the length of their shifts.<br />
> <img width="714" alt="solution2" src="https://github.com/Getsched/WorkFlow/assets/133157186/53da3b64-7a09-4072-989e-6ec3abd9333e"> <br />
> <br />
>
> 
#### Figure 3: Solution 3<br />
> This solution is the best one because it has a set number of shifts for each day, and the manager can choose the length of each shift<br />
> After an iterative design process, the final solution that best aligns with the project requirements, objectives, and constraints is a web-based scheduling application. This solution provides a user-friendly interface for both employees and employers while incorporating robust security measures, adhering to ethical standards, and contributing positively to environmental and societal aspects. <br />

> | Solution 1 | Employees input data, including their name, day, start time, and end time. <br>The input data format may vary among users. <br>Consequently, users, especially managers, may spend more time sorting and organizing the stored data. <br>This increased workload does not align with positive societal impacts, as it contributes to a rise in overall work burden. <br>Additionally, the current setup fails to meet sustainability goals, as all data is not displayed on a single page. <br>Users may resort to using other programs, such as Excel, and print the data on paper, undermining efforts to reduce paper usage and promote environmental sustainability. <br>This solution does not include having and salting and stores data in json file, and thus it does not meet regulatory compliance | Economic Factor(free to use)<br>Ethics(copyright regulations)                                                                                                                       |
> | Solution 2 | Having limited options could enhance usability; <br>however, the current system lacks the capability to print data on the same page. <br>Users might resort to using other programs to merge data and print it on paper, which undermines sustainability and has negative societal impacts. <br>Furthermore, the system fails to meet regulatory compliance as it stores data in JSON format without utilizing any other database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Economic Factor(free to use)<br>Ethics(copyright regulations)                                                                                                                       |
> | Solution 3 | It provides a button for users, allowing them to select their desired time slot. <br>The weekly timetable is then printed below the button, enabling users to easily view their shifts for the week. <br>The system utilizes MongoDB and passport, ensuring that all passwords are hashed and salted for enhanced security. <br>Managers have the capability to add or drop shifts, simplifying schedule maintenance. <br>Importantly, users do not need to use any other programs to print the schedule, ultimately saving on supplies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Economic Factor(free to use)<br>Ethics(copyright regulations)<br>Regulatory compliance(hashing and salting)<br>Sustainability(display weekly shift)<br>Societal impact(easy to use) |
